## Features

- **Custom Enchanting Method**: Instead of using the traditional enchanting table, this datapack allows you to craft enchantment tokens and apply enchantments through a simple in-game menu.
- **Add Enchantments with Ease**: To apply an enchantment, craft a token, hold the item you want to enchant (e.g., a sword), and then type the command:  
  `**/trigger _gui**`. A menu will appear, allowing you to select the enchantment you want.  
  Each time you click an enchantment, it will add 1 level to the item (up to the maximum level for that enchantment).
- **Fair Enchanting**: Enchantments are not free! You still need the required materials to craft the tokens.
