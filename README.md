## Features

- **Custom Enchanting Method**: Instead of using the traditional enchanting table, this datapack allows you to craft enchantment tokens and apply enchantments via an easy-to-use in-game menu.
- **Add Enchantments with Ease**: To apply an enchantment, craft a token, hold the item you want to enchant (e.g., a sword), and then use the command:  
  `**/trigger _gui**`. A menu will appear, letting you select the enchantment you want to apply.  
  Each time you click an enchantment, it will add one level to the item (up to the maximum level for that enchantment).
- **Fair Enchanting**: Enchantments aren't free! You still need the required materials to craft the tokens.
